Gaussian mixture models:

Could be quite usefull as it is an unsupervised algorithm that uses variance and is able to rate points that aren't clearly of one
cluster or the other. In the plots made 2 distinct clusters can be seen but there is also quite a lot of overlap, with points falling
in between clusters and plastic particles that are found in the void left by the bacteria after a freeze taw method was used. GMM gives
these points a score of how much they could belong to one cluster, which can help determining what they are.

Hierarchical clustering:

While useful in determining the clusters, might not be practicle because of the large amount of data.

DBSCAN

An algorithm that uses density's to determine the clusters. Density plots were the best plots used in the EDA to determine the difference
in bacteria and plastics, so an algorithm that uses density could be useful again as the plots give two visile density clusters, only
problem is that DBSCAN isn't good in classifying border points that exist between the two clusters and there are quite some points in
the data that fall under this categorie.

EM (Expectation maximalization):

Like DBSCAN a density machine learning algorithm that could be useful for the same reasons, with the added benifit of it's use of latent
variables, variables that might go unoticed by first inspection of the data as they are often quite small, but this algorithm is created
to find them and use them to better understand points at the clusters borders. This technique can also be used in GMM so atleast 
understanding EM would be useful.

OPTICS:
	- density, with weaknesses of DBSCAN adressed.
