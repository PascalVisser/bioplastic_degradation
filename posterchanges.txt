Abstract:
Bioplastic are polymers produced by micro-organisms. An example 
of a bioplastic is PHBV. PHBV is short for Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co
-3-hydroxyvalerate). PHBV is a thermoplastic polymer, and most important, is renewable.

The goal of the project is to calculate the degradation of these PHBV particles. This is done in
the following steps:
 - Data acquired from flow cytometry.
 - Statistical analysis on this data.
 - Creating a machine learning algorithms to distinguish bacteria from PHBV.
 - Calculating degradation over time through clustering.
 - Creation of an application to be used for further experiments.

Thus far a final dataset has been created from the original set that will be used
in the creation of a machine learning algorithm that will be created in the following
weeks.

Conclusion:
Many challanges arose form the dataset. As the data was contained in a uncommen format
and formulated strangly by the prior experiments. But through discussion with the original
author of the data and data analysis a final dataset was created to be used for the remainder
of the project.
