Job 1: Started with converting FCS file to CSV file

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 20 of /homes/lrmeulenkamp/thema12/workflow/snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
data/map1/*.fcs.csv
data/map2/*.fcs.csv
data/map3/*.fcs.csv
data/map4/*.fcs.csv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 1 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
